# Contributing

Welcome to the Hello-World Community!

Thinking of contributing to the Hello-World project? That's great, I would love to have you here.

Please make sure to read this guide on how to contribute and the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- Bug squashing and feature development on the Python script
- Building a user and developer documentation
- Reporting issues, including both feature requests, bug reports or if there is something missing in the [README.md](README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) or [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.

## Your first (codebase) contribution step by step

You can either work on an existing issue or create a new one. Make sure that you always indicate in the comments of the issue that you are working on it, so no one else starts to work on it as well. After you have done that follow the next steps.

1. Fork it (https://github.com/mrchntia/hello-world/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b feature-fooBar)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'). Please make sure that your commit message is meaningful and detailed.
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature-fooBar)
5. Create a new Pull Request

Notes:
- If you are uncomfortable with git here is a great [git tutorial](https://githowto.com/).

## Get in touch

Because this is still a very small project there is no chat forum for the community.
There will be a [Zulip chat](https://github.com/zulip) at some point in the future to improve communication of all contributors and make it easier to get help and give help to all problems that might occur.

So far please contact me via email ([mrchntia@gmail.com](mailto:mrchntia@gmail.com)) if you run into any kind of troubles or just want to introduce yourself as a new contributor.
